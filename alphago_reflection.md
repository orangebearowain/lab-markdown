1. The moment in the film that impacted me the most was seeing the intensity of the tournaments and the determination of the human players as they faced off against AlphaGo. Watching the tension build as world-class Go players challenged the AI was eye-opening. The players were fully invested in their strategies and gave it their all, but AlphaGo’s abilities were clearly beyond their reach. It really highlighted how large the gap is between human intuition and AI decision-making, and it made me appreciate the level of innovation and effort that went into creating AlphaGo.

2. AlphaGo’s approach to decision-making was completely different from that of the human players. It wasn’t based on intuition or experience, but on complex calculations and the ability to analyze millions of possible moves in a fraction of a second. AlphaGo could explore strategies that humans wouldn’t have thought of, which allowed it to take risks and make moves that were unconventional but effective. Human players, on the other hand, relied on years of practice, intuition, and established strategies, while AlphaGo used computational power to make decisions grounded in deep analysis and simulations.

3. What surprised me most about how AlphaGo learned and played the game was how it could think so many steps ahead and make moves that, at first, seemed risky but were actually well-calculated. It wasn’t just following patterns—it was actively pushing the boundaries of the game, coming up with strategies that human players hadn’t seen before. This kind of advanced reasoning was unexpected and showed how far AI can go.

4. I believe AlphaGo demonstrated creativity. Even though it was an AI, its gameplay involved breaking away from traditional rules and exploring new possibilities. By doing this, it pushed the limits of what was considered possible in Go, showing creativity in how it approached the game and adapted in surprising ways.
